# Fidelity-of-reviews

To write a naive Bayes classifier to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative. Use the word tokens as features for classification.

The data files are in the following format:
    A text file train-text.txt with a single training instance (hotel review) per line. The first token in the each line is a unique 20-character alphanumeric identifier, which is followed by the text of the review.
    A label file train-labels.txt with labels for the corresponding reviews. Each line consists of three tokens: a unique 20-character alphanumeric identifier corresponding to a review, a label truthful or deceptive, and a label positive or negative. 

Each data file contains 1280 lines, corresponding to 1280 reviews.
